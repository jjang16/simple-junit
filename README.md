# simple-junit
Simple junit runner!

## How to use
Java and Javac should be installed <br />
<br />
1. Place all your source codes under project/src directory <br />
2. Place all your external libraries under project/lib directory (don't add junit) <br />
3. Run "python run.py" <br />

<br /> 
It will run all tests for you, just as eclipse does! <br />
It should work in all platforms. (tested only in osx)

## For cs498dm class,
Feel free to test this too!
